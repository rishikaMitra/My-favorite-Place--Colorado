            <p>I liked Colorado, because I really nature, and it had mountains, and there was igenaus rock. I also liked going there because there were lots of things to learn about. We learned about mountains,and got really good pictures from the expierence.I also liked the Amtrak Train, so you might think traveling through a train through mountains, can make you sick,but it was a really good train. It was just an amazing adventure, and I think everyone should go there, it is awesome.</p>
